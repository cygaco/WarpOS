# Friction, Trust & Forms

**A form is the moment of friction where intent is converted into a completed action; this guide is the discipline of removing every unnecessary obstacle (fewer fields, visible labels, forgiving validation, correct mobile inputs) and supplying the trust the user needs at the point of commitment — so the form is the easiest possible bridge from "I'm interested" to "done."**

This guide trains `conversion-lead` (forms on landing/checkout surfaces) and `design-lead` (in-app forms), and yields checkable rules for the `design-quality` `component-usage` + `accessibility` axes and the `visual-review` `copy` + `a11y` + `layout` categories.

---

## 1. What this is

Every form is a transaction: the user gives effort (and data, and trust) in exchange for an outcome. Each field, each ambiguity, each error is **friction** that taxes that exchange — and abandonment is the result. Form design is the systematic reduction of friction subject to two constraints: the form must still be **accessible** (it inherits all of `ACCESSIBILITY_WCAG`'s form rules) and **trustworthy** (the user must believe it's safe to proceed). The core moves:

- **Minimize and justify fields** — every field must earn its place; ask only for what's needed *now*.
- **Visible, persistent labels** — the user always knows what each field wants.
- **Forgiving, helpful validation** — catch errors at the right time, in plain language, with the fix.
- **Right input for the device** — correct types, keyboards, and autofill so typing is minimal.
- **Trust at the point of commitment** — signals and message-match so the user feels safe submitting.
- **Respect the journey** — the ad → lander → offer scent must be continuous; never jump cold to a heavy form.

---

## 2. Why it matters

**For the product/user:** forms are where conversions are won or lost. Friction is measurable abandonment — Baymard's research finds the average checkout asks for **roughly twice as many fields as needed**, and complex/confusing layout is a top abandonment cause. A user who can't tell what a field wants (placeholder vanished), who gets yelled at mid-typing, who hits a vague "invalid input," or who is asked for sensitive data with no trust context, quietly leaves. On mobile, a wrong keyboard or a missing autofill turns a 20-second task into a frustrating one.

**For the designer agents:**
- Forms are a shared surface for both designer agents (in-app for `design-lead`, lead/checkout for `conversion-lead`).
- This guide governs `component-usage` (form primitives: label, input, error, fieldset), `accessibility` (the form's whole a11y story), and `copy` (labels, helper text, error messages) — so it sits at the intersection of multiple gauntlet axes.
- It is the conversion guide's natural partner: `CONVERSION_HIERARCHY` gets the click to the CTA; this guide gets the form *completed*.

---

## 3. Core principles / techniques

### 3.1 Minimize and justify every field

The strongest lever on completion is **field count**. Every field is a cost; remove any that isn't required *at this step*. Practical rules:
- Ask only for what you genuinely need now; defer the rest (progressive profiling).
- Don't ask for data you can derive or default (infer city/state from a postal/zip; don't ask "confirm email" if you offer good validation).
- For each remaining field, you should be able to answer "why do we need this here?" — if not, cut it.
- Avoid optional fields on critical paths; an optional field still costs attention and decision.

> **Nuance (contrarian):** "fewer fields always wins" is mostly true but not absolute — the real driver of abandonment is *unnecessary* fields and confusing layout, not raw count. A form that asks for what's clearly needed, well-structured, beats a "minimal" form that hides required steps. Cut the *unjustified*, not the *necessary*.

### 3.2 Single-column layout

Use a **single column**. Multi-column forms break the vertical scan, create ambiguous tab/reading order, and cause users to miss fields or misread which label belongs to which input. The exception is genuinely paired short fields (e.g., expiry month/year, or city + state) that are clearly related and short — keep those on a line, everything else stacks.

### 3.3 Visible, persistent labels — never placeholder-as-label

Each field needs a **visible label that stays visible**, positioned **above the field** (top-aligned). Why:
- **Placeholder-as-label is harmful** — the placeholder disappears the moment the user types, so a distracted user (or one fixing an error) loses the field's meaning and has to clear the field to re-read it. NN/g and Baymard both document increased errors and completion time. Placeholders also typically fail contrast and aren't reliably announced by assistive tech.
- **Top-aligned labels** let users complete forms fastest (eye-tracking: nearly 2× faster than left-aligned) because the label and field are on the same vertical scan line, and they reflow cleanly on mobile.
- A placeholder, if used at all, is a **format hint** ("MM/YY"), *in addition to* a real label — never a replacement.
- Floating labels are a contested middle ground: acceptable when implemented so the label remains legible after input, but a plain top-aligned label is the safer default.

### 3.4 Mark required vs optional explicitly

Don't leave the user guessing. Either mark **required** fields (asterisk + a legend, and `required`/`aria-required`) or, when most fields are required, mark the **optional** ones ("(optional)"). Be consistent. Relying on color alone (e.g., "required fields are red") fails accessibility (not-color-alone) — use text/symbol with an explained legend.

### 3.5 Forgiving, well-timed validation

Validation should help, not punish:
- **Timing:** validate **on blur** (after the user leaves a field they've interacted with), **not on every keystroke** for errors — keystroke-level red errors feel like the form is yelling while the user is still typing, and they create constant screen-reader noise. Exceptions where live feedback *helps*: password-strength meters and username-availability checks (positive, additive feedback). Once a field is in an error state, *clearing* the error live as the user fixes it is good.
- **Don't validate untouched fields** before submit; on submit, surface errors for the fields that failed and move focus to the first error.
- **Be tolerant of format:** accept spaces/dashes in card and phone numbers, trim whitespace, be case-insensitive on emails — normalize on the backend rather than rejecting human input.
- **Never wipe the form on error** — preserve everything the user typed.

### 3.6 Error messages that state the requirement and the fix

An error message must tell the user **what's wrong and how to fix it**, in plain language — not "Invalid input." Good: "Enter an email address that includes an @ and a domain, e.g. name@example.com." The message must be:
- **Specific** (which field, what rule),
- **Actionable** (what to do),
- **Adjacent** to the field (and associated programmatically),
- **Polite in tone** (describe the requirement, don't scold).

### 3.7 Accessible error wiring (inherited floor)

Forms carry their accessibility with them:
- Each input has an associated **visible label** (`<label for>` or wrapping).
- On failure, set **`aria-invalid="true"`** on the field (only *after* validation, never on a pristine required field).
- Associate the message via **`aria-describedby`** pointing to the message element.
- For dynamically-appearing errors, use a **live region** (`role="alert"` for the error, or an `aria-live` summary) so screen-reader users hear it.
- A post-submit **error summary** at the top, with links to each failed field, helps everyone on long forms.
(These map directly to `ACCESSIBILITY_WCAG` rules A11Y-08 and A11Y-19.)

### 3.8 Right input for the device (mobile friction)

Typing on mobile is the biggest friction multiplier. Reduce it:
- Use the correct **`type`** (`email`, `tel`, `url`, `number`) and **`inputmode`** (`numeric`, `decimal`, `email`, `tel`) so the right on-screen keyboard appears.
- Use **`autocomplete`** tokens (`name`, `email`, `tel`, `street-address`, `postal-code`, `cc-number`, `one-time-code`) so browsers/password managers can autofill — this is both a friction win and an accessibility win.
- Set `autocapitalize`/`autocorrect` sensibly (off for email/usernames).
- Ensure inputs and the submit control meet **target-size** (≥24px min, ≥44px ergonomic for primary) and are reachable above the mobile keyboard.

### 3.9 Trust at the point of commitment

Friction isn't only effort — it's also **doubt**. Supply trust where commitment happens:
- Put **trust signals** near the sensitive ask and near the submit: security/privacy reassurance for payment or personal data ("We never share your email"), recognizable proof, a clear statement of what happens next ("No card required," "You can cancel anytime").
- Make the **submit button label specific** about the outcome ("Create my account," "Start free trial") rather than generic ("Submit") — it sets expectation and reduces hesitation.
- Give **feedback on submit**: a loading/disabled state to prevent double-submit, and clear success or error afterward (no silent submit — see interaction-states).

### 3.10 Respect the journey (ad → lander → offer)

The form is the end of a path. **Message-match** the form to what brought the user there: the ad's promise, the lander's value prop, and the offer must be continuous ("scent"). Don't drop a high-intent visitor cold into a heavy form with no context, and don't ask for commitment disproportionate to the relationship so far (no credit card to "see pricing"). For long asks, **chunk into steps** with progress indication when the total field count is high (multi-step tends to beat single-page once a form is long), but don't add steps to a short form where extra clicks are pure friction.

> **Good friction exists:** intentional friction is correct for **destructive or irreversible** actions (delete account, confirm payment) — a confirmation step here protects the user. Friction-reduction applies to *acquisition* flows, not to safety-critical confirmations.

## 4. Concrete examples (build terms — Next/Tailwind/Radix/shadcn)

**Label vs placeholder — DON'T / DO**
- DON'T: `<input placeholder="Email" />` (placeholder as the only label — vanishes on type, fails a11y).
- DO: `<label htmlFor="email">Email</label><input id="email" type="email" autoComplete="email" inputMode="email" placeholder="name@example.com" />` — persistent top-aligned label; placeholder is a format hint only.

**Required/optional marking — DO**
- `<label htmlFor="phone">Phone <span className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">(optional)</span></label>` — explicit, text-based (not color-only), consistent across the form.

**Validation timing — DON'T / DO**
- DON'T: `onChange` handler that flips the field red on every keystroke.
- DO: validate `onBlur` after interaction; clear the error live as the user fixes it; on submit, focus the first invalid field. Use the shadcn/react-hook-form pattern with `mode: "onBlur"` (or `onTouched`).

**Error message + a11y wiring — DON'T / DO**
- DON'T: `<p className="text-red-500">Invalid input</p>` floating with no association.
- DO:
  `<input id="email" aria-invalid={hasError} aria-describedby={hasError ? "email-err" : undefined} />`
  `{hasError && <p id="email-err" role="alert" className="text-sm text-destructive">Enter an email with an @ and a domain, e.g. name@example.com</p>}`

**Mobile input — DON'T / DO**
- DON'T: `<input type="text" />` for a phone number → full QWERTY keyboard, no autofill.
- DO: `<input type="tel" inputMode="tel" autoComplete="tel" />` → numeric keypad + autofill. For OTP: `autoComplete="one-time-code" inputMode="numeric"`.

**Field minimization — DON'T / DO**
- DON'T: signup asking name, email, password, confirm-password, company, phone, how-did-you-hear.
- DO: email + password only (derive/ask the rest later via progressive profiling); drop "confirm password" in favor of a show-password toggle + good validation.

**Single column — DON'T / DO**
- DON'T: two/three-column field grid that scatters tab order.
- DO: one column stacked; only genuinely paired short fields (expiry MM/YY) share a row.

**Trust at submit — DO**
- Near the submit: `<Button type="submit">Create my account</Button>` + a one-line reassurance ("No credit card required") + a disabled/loading state on submit to prevent double-submit.

## 5. Common failure modes

| Failure | How it reads to the user | How to detect |
|---|---|---|
| Placeholder used as the label | Label vanishes on type; user forgets what the field wants; a11y fail | `<input>` with `placeholder` and no associated `<label>`/`aria-label` |
| No required/optional marking | "Do I have to fill this?" guessing; surprise errors | Required fields not marked (text/symbol + `required`), or marked by color only |
| Validate-on-keystroke errors | Form "yells" mid-typing; constant red; SR noise | Error state toggled on `onChange`/keystroke rather than blur/submit |
| Vague error ("Invalid input") | User doesn't know what's wrong or how to fix it | Error text lacks the rule + the fix; generic wording |
| Error not tied to the field | SR users can't find the error; sighted users hunt | Error not linked via `aria-describedby`; no `aria-invalid`; no `role=alert` |
| Too many / unjustified fields | "This is a lot" → abandonment | Field count exceeds what the step needs; optional fields on a critical path |
| Wrong input type / no autocomplete (mobile) | Wrong keyboard; no autofill; tedious typing | `type="text"` for email/tel/number; missing `inputmode`/`autocomplete` |
| Form wiped on error | User re-types everything; rage-quit | Submitted values not preserved on validation failure |
| No submit feedback / double-submit | "Did it work?"; duplicate submissions | Submit has no loading/disabled state; no success/error after |
| Sensitive ask with no trust context | "Why do they need my card to see pricing?" → distrust | Payment/personal data requested with no reassurance/explanation near it |
| Cold ad→offer jump (no message match) | "This isn't what the ad said" → bounce | Form/offer copy doesn't match the ad/lander promise (scent break) |
| Multi-column or scattered layout | Misread labels; skipped fields | >1 column for non-paired fields; ambiguous label↔field proximity |

## 6. ✅ Agent-applicable RULES (the payoff)

Format: **[ID] severity — assertion → maps_to → detection (observed vs expected).**

- **[FORM-01] critical — Every input has a persistent, visible, programmatically-associated label; the placeholder is NOT the label.** → `component-usage` / `accessibility` / `a11y` / `copy`. Detect: `<input>/<select>/<textarea>` with a `placeholder` and no `<label for>`/wrapping label/`aria-label` = FAIL (cross-checks A11Y-08).
- **[FORM-02] serious — Labels are top-aligned (above the field) and the form is a single column** (only genuinely paired short fields share a row). → `layout` / `component-usage`. Detect: inline/inside labels, or multi-column layout for unrelated fields = FAIL/WARN.
- **[FORM-03] serious — Required vs optional is marked explicitly with text/symbol (+ `required`/`aria-required`), consistently, never by color alone.** → `component-usage` / `accessibility` / `copy`. Detect: required fields unmarked, inconsistent marking, or color-only marking = FAIL (cross-checks A11Y-04).
- **[FORM-04] serious — Validation fires on blur/submit, not on every keystroke for error states; untouched fields aren't pre-flagged; errors clear as the user fixes them.** → `component-usage` / `a11y`. Detect: error state toggled on `onChange`/keystroke; `aria-invalid="true"` on a pristine field = FAIL.
- **[FORM-05] serious — Error messages state the specific requirement AND the fix, in plain language (not "Invalid input").** → `copy` / `a11y`. Detect: generic/vague error text, or text that names the problem but not the fix = FAIL.
- **[FORM-06] critical — Each error is associated to its field via `aria-describedby`, the field gets `aria-invalid="true"` after failure, and dynamically-shown errors use a live region (`role=alert`/`aria-live`).** → `accessibility` / `a11y` / `component-usage`. Detect: error not linked, `aria-invalid` missing, or async error inserted with no live region = FAIL (cross-checks A11Y-19/A11Y-20).
- **[FORM-07] serious — Field count is minimized and justified; no unjustified or optional fields on a critical path; no data asked that can be derived/deferred.** → `component-usage` / `copy`. Detect: fields present with no clear need at this step (e.g., "confirm email", "how did you hear" on signup), or optional fields cluttering a critical flow = WARN/FAIL.
- **[FORM-08] serious — Inputs use the correct `type` + `inputmode` + `autocomplete` for mobile keyboards and autofill.** → `component-usage` / `mobile-responsive` / `accessibility`. Detect: `type="text"` for email/tel/number/url; missing `inputmode` on numeric fields; missing `autocomplete` tokens on common fields (name/email/tel/address/cc/otp) = FAIL/WARN.
- **[FORM-09] serious — The form preserves user input on validation error (never wipes) and is tolerant of human formatting (spaces/dashes in card/phone, trimmed/lowercased email).** → `component-usage` / `copy`. Detect: values cleared on error; format rejected that could be normalized = FAIL.
- **[FORM-10] serious — Submit gives feedback (loading/disabled state to prevent double-submit) and a clear success/error outcome; no silent submit.** → `component-usage` / `console-error` / `a11y`. Detect: submit control with no pending/disabled state, or no post-submit success/error feedback = FAIL (pairs with interaction-states).
- **[FORM-11] minor — Trust is supplied at the point of commitment: reassurance near sensitive fields/submit, a specific submit-button label naming the outcome, and an honest "what happens next."** → `copy` / `layout`. Detect: payment/personal-data ask with no reassurance nearby; generic "Submit" label = WARN.
- **[FORM-12] minor — The form respects the journey: copy/offer message-matches the ad/lander (scent), commitment is proportionate (no card to "see pricing"), and long forms are chunked into steps with progress while short forms stay single-page.** → `copy` / `layout`. Detect: scent break between source and form/offer; disproportionate ask; needless multi-step on a <5-field form, or an unchunked very long form = WARN.
- **[FORM-13] minor — Interactive form targets meet size (≥24px min, ≥44px for primary submit) and reflow above the mobile keyboard.** → `accessibility` / `mobile-responsive` / `a11y`. Detect: sub-24px controls, or submit hidden behind the on-screen keyboard = WARN (cross-checks A11Y-15).

> **Note on good friction:** none of these rules apply to *intentional* confirmation friction on destructive/irreversible actions (delete, pay, irreversible change) — there, a confirmation step is correct and removing it would be the defect.
