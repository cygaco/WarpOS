/**
 * FALSIFIER: checked-equals-landed — β R2 TEETH (SP-20260721-001 D-4 INC-1, unit SEC-1).
 *
 * THE ATTACK: the caller asks the transport to land a commit whose OWN tree FAILS the pinned suite, while
 * supplying a CLEAN tree alongside it (a `candidateRoot` pointing at a pristine directory, a clean working
 * directory on disk, a clean sibling commit). If the transport checked the tree it was HANDED rather than
 * the tree it will LAND, the suite would pass over the clean tree and the poisoned tree would land. That
 * is the checked ≠ landed false-green: the artifact that was verified is not the artifact that ships.
 *
 * MUST HOLD (β R2): the suite runs over the tree materialized from the landing commit's EXACT SHA, out of
 * the object store. A separately-supplied tree/working-dir/candidateRoot cannot be substituted. A failing
 * tree is REFUSED — main never moves.
 *
 * THE FAILURE IS REAL, NOT STUBBED: the poisoned commit carries a genuine NUL-byte file, which the pinned
 * `no-nul-bytes` check genuinely fails. No mocked verdict; a mocked failure would prove only that the code
 * propagates a mock.
