/**
 * FALSIFIER: broker-acceptance — the α+β RIDER (SP-20260721-001 D-4 INC-1, unit SEC-1).
 *
 * THE PAIRED CLAIM, proven end-to-end on a SCRATCH repo with the REAL `reference-transaction` hook:
 *   NEGATIVE — a NON-brokered main-write (a plain `git merge` / `git commit` / `git update-ref`, no lease,
 *              no fence) is REFUSED in the hook's PREPARED phase, so the ref NEVER MOVES.
 *   POSITIVE — a BROKERED write through the transport entrypoints (holding the lease, fence raised by
 *              `withControllerFence`) LANDS on that same repo, with that same hook installed.
 *
 * BOTH HALVES ARE REQUIRED. The negative alone is satisfied by a hook that refuses everything — which
 * would "secure" the ref by making it unwritable and would be caught only in production. The positive
 * alone proves nothing about un-brokered writes. Together they prove the fence discriminates on the ONE
 * property that matters: did this write come through the broker?
 *
 * PREPARED-PHASE MATTERS: `reference-transaction` fires `prepared` BEFORE the ref moves. A refusal there
 * means the write is rejected, not rolled back — no window in which main briefly holds an unverified head.
 *
 * HONEST CEILING (named, not papered over — this falsifier does NOT claim to close these): an attacker
 * who can redirect `core.hooksPath`, delete the hook file, write `.git/refs` directly, or forge the fence
 * env vars in their own process defeats this mechanism. Those are OPERATOR-DROPPED risks, out of scope
 * for a repo-local hook, and are recorded as such rather than silently implied to be covered.
