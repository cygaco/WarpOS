 * FALSIFIER: bundle-corrupt-configured-refused-no-fallback — GF-1 / R2-F1 TEETH
 * (SP-20260721-001 D-4 INC-1, unit MIG dogfood fallback-visibility).
 *
 * THE ATTACK: the fallback-visibility ledger's honesty rests on ONE partition — a security refusal must
 * NEVER be fallback-eligible. The GF-1 class is a SECURITY reason leaking into the operational bucket:
 *   (a) a pinned bundle that is CONFIGURED (a path was supplied) but is MISSING / unstatable — deleted,
 *       access-denied, or swapped out from under the broker; and
 *   (b) a configured bundle that EXISTS but is CORRUPT / structurally-incomplete (truncated JSON, missing
 *       required fields) — a tampered promoted bundle.
 * If either mapped to an OPERATIONAL reason, the broker would fall back to the ordinary un-brokered route
 * and land exactly the write it could not verify — a silent bypass, and a fabricated "operational" line in
 * the ledger the flip decision is argued from.
 *
 * MUST HOLD (conservative-by-construction): both (a) and (b) are SECURITY refusals. NO fallback. The ref
 * NEVER moves. Only the honest ABSENCE of any configured bundle (no path supplied at all) stays operational.
