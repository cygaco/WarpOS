/**
 * FALSIFIER: cas-anchor-caller-adopted-ignored — β R1 TEETH (SP-20260721-001 D-4 INC-1, unit SEC-1).
 *
 * THE ATTACK: a caller supplies its OWN CAS anchor — `base_commit` / `expectedHead` — on the input object
 * and through `opts`. If the transport ADOPTED it, the compare-and-swap would be performed against a head
 * the CALLER chose rather than the head that is actually live. That is the classic TOCTOU land: a merge
 * built on an old base gets swapped onto a ref that has since advanced, silently discarding the
 * intervening commit(s), with git's own CAS none the wiser because it was handed the stale value as
 * "expected".
 *
 * MUST HOLD (β R1): the caller's anchor is IGNORED — not validated, not preferred, never read. The CAS
 * `expectedHead` is ALWAYS the RE-RESOLVED live tip of the target ref.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SHARPER THAN THE ENTRYPOINT UNIT TEST: the BE-1 unit test asserts the RECEIPT reports the
 * live head. A receipt is a REPORT — a transport could report one anchor and pass another to git. Here we
 * intercept the ACTUAL `refUpdater` call and read the expectedHead argument that git would receive. What
 * is claimed and what is used are checked to be the same value. MUST-BLOCK on the stale-anchor variant.
