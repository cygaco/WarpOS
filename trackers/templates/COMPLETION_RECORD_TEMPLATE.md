<!-- COMPLETION RECORD TEMPLATE — completion fields from spec §15 (completed epics),
     §16 (completed sprints), and the §37 Definition-of-Done gate. Paste into the
     "Completion record" section of an epic or sprint tracker when (and only when) the item
     is actually complete. An item must NOT be recorded complete unless its parent TRACKER.md
     entry also confirms completion (§15/§16), and not at 100% unless every §20/§28.6 gate is met.
     Replace every <angle-bracket> placeholder. -->
