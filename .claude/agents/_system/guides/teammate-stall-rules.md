# Teammate Stall Rules — the fire-and-poll pattern (WG-6 / #29)

**Status:** LIVE doctrine (Wave-2 #29). This is the verified rewrite of the
"TEAMMATE STALL RULES (WG-6)" that currently reads in
`.claude/agents/president/epsilon.md` and is cross-referenced from
`paths.agentDispatchGuide` (`.claude/agents/_system/guides/agent-dispatch-guide.md`).
Those two files are frozen on the in-flight dispatch sprint branch; the
fold-back of this pattern into them is logged as enforcement-debt (see the
Enforcer section). Until then, THIS file is the canonical stall doctrine.

## The failure it prevents

A teammate-ε (or any teammate) that launches **background** subprocesses and
then goes idle "waiting for returns" waits **forever**. The harness re-wakes a
teammate ONLY on an incoming `SendMessage` — a subprocess completing does **not**
trigger a re-wake, and an in-process `Agent(…, run_in_background:true)` return
is a different lane. The belief "the harness re-wakes me when my subprocess
finishes" is FALSE. Observed as 25-minute stalls ×3 (WG-6).

## The old rule, and why it was too blunt

The prior doctrine said, in effect: **"NEVER go idle while a background
subprocess is outstanding; dispatch subprocesses BLOCKING/foreground."** That
is safe but serializes everything — a conductor that must fan out N reviewers
can only run them one-at-a-time in the foreground, and cannot overlap a long
build with anything else.

## The verified pattern: FIRE-AND-POLL

You do not have to choose between "block foreground" and "idle forever." The
correct shape is **fire the work, then actively poll a durable signal** in the
SAME turn — you never yield control to an event that will not fire.

1. **FIRE** — launch the subprocess(es). Background fan-out is allowed *provided
   you poll* (below). For a single dependency, a bounded blocking/foreground
   dispatch is still the simplest correct choice.
2. **POLL a durable signal, in-turn** — do not `await` an inbox that will not
   wake. Poll one of these until your bound elapses:
   - **The signal board** (`scripts/teams/signal-board.js`, guide
     `signal-channel.md`): `wait <topic> --timeout <s> --poll <ms>` blocks the
     poller in-process and returns exit 0 with the ruling the moment a teammate
     posts it, exit 3 on timeout. This is the accelerator for **teammate
     rulings/verdicts** (β at a phase boundary, a Director's call).
   - **The completion ledger** (`gauntlet-verify` / `epsilon-liveness.js`): for
     **dispatched worker** returns, the ground truth is the durable completion
     record, not narration. Poll the ledger / re-run `gauntlet-verify` for the
     run window; absence of an `ok:true` well-formed record IS the death signal.
3. **BOUND every poll.** A poll without a timeout is just a stall with extra
   steps. On timeout, take a recovery action (re-dispatch, or report state to
   the lead), never silently keep waiting.
4. **Report state before any UNAVOIDABLE idle point.** If you must yield, first
   `SendMessage` the lead concrete state: what is outstanding and where its
   evidence will land, so the lead can watchdog and recover (idle ≠ dead — a
   `SendMessage` wakes an idle teammate; no readiness ping after spawn ≈ reaped,
   RI-004-class → re-spawn).

## Why fire-and-poll is safe (it closes the wake-gap by construction)

The stall bug is a **missing wake event**. Polling removes the dependency on a
wake event entirely: the poller drives the clock itself and observes the
durable artifact (a posted signal, or a completion record) directly. You are
never parked on an event the harness will not deliver.

## The paired-waiter protocol — the lead-side accelerator (wake-drop kill)

Fire-and-poll closes the wake-gap from the *teammate's* side, but a teammate's
own poll interval is coarse (10s–minutes) and the harness re-wake it leans on for
a lead relay can itself DROP — measured **2026-07-21 as ~5 dropped re-wakes
costing ~45–60 min**. The structural accelerator is a **paired waiter on the
lead's side**, so a completion relays in *seconds* rather than on the teammate's
next poll tick. Four rings, each independent:

1. **The dispatch envelope MUST carry the `dispatch_id` + the expected artifact
   path.** Every time a teammate fires a background dispatch, its status
   `SendMessage` to the team-lead names (a) the `dispatch_id` and (b) the absolute
   path of the completion record / evidence artifact the dispatch will write. An
   envelope missing these two fields **cannot be waited on** — it is a silent-drop
   waiting to happen. (This is the arming input; without it, ring 2 is impossible.)
2. **The team-lead immediately arms a harness-tracked bg waiter.** On receiving
   the envelope the lead launches a background Bash loop that blocks on the durable
   artifact and relays the instant it appears:
   ```bash
   until grep -q '"dispatch_id":"<id>".*"completed_at"' "$COMPLETIONS_LEDGER"; do sleep 10; done
   # then: SendMessage the teammate "<id> completed → <artifact path>"
   ```
   (`$COMPLETIONS_LEDGER` = `paths.dispatchCompletionsFile`.) Because the lead's bg
   Bash is **harness-tracked**, its exit re-wakes the lead deterministically, and
   the lead's relay `SendMessage` re-wakes the idle teammate deterministically —
   **two reliable wakes replacing the one that drops.**
3. **The teammate keeps its own in-turn poller (defense-in-depth).** The lead's
   waiter is primary; the teammate's fire-and-poll (above) is the backup, so a
   dropped lead relay still resolves on the teammate's next tick. Neither path is
   trusted alone; together they are two independent routes to the same signal.
4. **Watchdog ticks remain the OUTER fallback.** The adaptive watchdog cadence
   (below) is the third ring — it catches the case where BOTH the lead waiter and
   the teammate poll somehow miss.

**Evidence (2026-07-21):** where the lead armed an `until`-loop waiter, completion
relayed in ~seconds (the DUMP's "α until-loops fired instantly" note); where a bare
harness re-wake was relied on, ~5 drops cost ~45–60 min. The paired waiter converts
a single fragile wake into a redundant pair — the wake-drop kill.

**Enforcer (debt, ED-256):** the arm-a-waiter half is behavioral — nothing asserts
the lead armed a waiter for each outstanding dispatch, nor that the envelope carried
the two required fields. Candidate: a **waiter-armed check in the sprint liveness
scan** (`scripts/checks/epsilon-liveness.js`) that, for each outstanding teammate bg
dispatch in `paths.dispatchCompletionsFile`, asserts either a lead-armed waiter
process is live OR the envelope recorded `dispatch_id` + artifact path — flagging
idle-with-outstanding-dispatch-and-no-waiter. **Residual to name when built
(DP-gap #41b, field-present ≠ behavior-fires):** the envelope-field assertion is
the deterministic write-time firing part; "a waiter process is live" is a weaker
runtime signal, and the `OR` lets the field-path satisfy the check alone — so this
enforces the envelope CONTRACT, not the waiter-ARMING BEHAVIOR. The behavior-signal
wants a **wake-drop telemetry counter** (alert when drops exceed a threshold), not
just a field check. (Ledger is gitignored/machine-local — split-durability: the
future enforcer resolves the cited ED id from THIS committed doc, not the ledger.)

## Shared-ledger write discipline — the ledger-side sibling of the paired-waiter

Parallel lanes writing to the SAME runtime append-log (`paths.enforcementDebt` =
`.claude/project/memory/enforcement-debt.jsonl`, and any shared `.jsonl` ledger)
race the same way a dispatched worker's wake does — and the fix is the same shape:
make the write atomic-by-construction, never rely on a stale read.

1. **APPEND with the next-free id read AT write time — never pre-announce an id as
   final.** Ids are MINTED at write time, not reserved by announcement. On
   2026-07-21 (SP-20260721-002) both the doctrine lane and the parallel INC-3 lane
   read "highest = ED-252" early and each planned "ED-253"; the second append
   created a transient duplicate ED-253. Re-read the ledger immediately before the
   write, take the ACTUAL next-free, and report the REAL minted id in your
   envelope — never the pre-announced one. **Caveat:** read-next-free-at-write-time
   only SHRINKS the collision window (to the read→append gap); it does NOT close it
   — two lanes can each read the same next-free and both append it (write-atomic,
   id-colliding). Only atomic ALLOCATION closes the class (see Enforcer).
2. **NEVER read-filter-rewrite a shared ledger — repair is ALWAYS
   single-writer-coordinated.** A whole-file rewrite (to dedup or renumber) reads
   the file, edits in memory, and writes it back — clobbering any concurrent append
   that landed in the window (lost-update race). You cannot reliably OBSERVE that no
   other lane is appending (the operator or another agent may), so the rule is
   UNCONDITIONAL, not "while another lane is active": never self-heal a shared ledger
   in place. `O_APPEND` gives WRITE-atomicity (two concurrent appends both LAND,
   neither clobbers — exactly what a rewrite loses); it does NOT give id-allocation
   atomicity (that residual is discipline 1's, closed only by the Enforcer's
   allocator). **Dedup / repair is a SINGLE-WRITER maintenance action** — coordinate
   it through the team lead (one writer, no live co-writer), never a mid-flight
   self-heal.
3. **Verify ledger state by direct READ, never a grep-count.** grep gave a
   false-negative on this ledger (a present `"id":"ED-253"` counted 0 — the
   BOM/long-line fresh-migration class); the Read tool showed the truth. Confirm
   which ids are live by Read before reporting or repairing.

**Enforcer — two tiers:**
- **Cheap, self-detecting (build first): a ledger duplicate-id lint — keyed on
  GENESIS records, NOT bare id-count.** A ledger is APPEND-ONLY (discipline 2), so an
  ED is CLOSED (or amended) by APPENDING a record with the SAME id — every closed ED
  legitimately carries its id ≥2× (an open genesis + a closure). So flag an id only
  when it has **>1 GENESIS record** — a record that is NOT a closure/status-update/
  amendment (exclude any record carrying `status:closed`, `closure_receipt`,
  `closed_ts`, or an `amends` / `record_kind:amendment` marker). One open + N
  closures/amendments = OK (lifecycle); TWO genesis records with the same id = the
  real cross-lane collision (today's ED-253). **Read-based, not a grep-count**
  (discipline 3's false-negative), wired into `/scan:full`. Its test MUST plant BOTH:
  a closed ED (open+closure pair) that PASSES, and a seeded same-id two-genesis
  fixture that REDs. A bare "id appears ≥2× = dup" lint would false-RED on EVERY
  closed ED — e.g. the legitimately-closed **ED-244** (open genesis + closure
  `SP-20260720-003`, which must PASS) — and flood `/scan:full`: the DP-gap #38
  over-broad-detector-that-gets-dismissed (the false-green inverse), worse than no
  lint (β DIRECTIVE 2026-07-21, 0.90). Filed as LOW enforcement-debt **ED-258** — the
  named enforcer that closes the hygiene bar without waiting on the root fix.
- **Root fix (legitimately deferred): atomic id-allocation** — a lock or a
  monotonic allocator so two lanes cannot mint the same id (the only thing that
  CLOSES discipline 1's residual, per the caveat above). Deferred because this
  collision was first-occurrence, transient, self-recovered, no data loss (unlike
  the recurring-cost ED-256/257). Concrete trigger to file the `id-allocation-race`
  ED or build the allocator: the **SECOND** real collision, OR **any** collision
  causing actual DATA LOSS (not a transient renumber).

(Durable citation: this committed doc, not the gitignored ledger — same
split-durability as ED-256/257.)

## Poll patience — the 540s clamp bound (live evidence, 2026-07-16)

Do not declare a dispatch dead early. Tonight's ledger gave three deterministic
signals about WHEN a worker is actually gone:

- **Long reviewers die at the clamp, not at random.** Two `backend-reviewer`
  runs died at **exactly the 540s timeout clamp** (`elapsed_ms` ≈ 540000 in the
  ledger — deterministic, not a random reap). A death right at the clamp is a
  *timeout*, a distinct failure class from an early silent reap.
- **"Reaped" often means "not done yet."** BOTH `qa` attempts the conductor
  declared reaped had actually **COMPLETED late** — their artifacts landed at
  00:53:58, after the conductor had already written them off. The narration was
  wrong; the artifact was the truth.
- **Short dispatches never died.** The β consults (22–100s) always returned.
  Short lanes are not the risk; long lanes near the clamp are.

**The bound:** nothing is dead before **540s + margin**. Before declaring a
long-running dispatch dead:

1. Keep polling until at least the clamp bound (`DISPATCH_BUILDER_TIMEOUT_MS`,
   ~540s) plus a margin has elapsed — an earlier "no return yet" is expected,
   not death.
2. **Check for the artifact before declaring death** — look for the completion
   record / evidence file the dispatch was told to write. A late-landing
   artifact (the qa case above) beats a premature "reaped" verdict every time.
3. Only after the bound has passed AND no artifact exists is the lane a genuine
   death (re-dispatch). A death *at* the clamp is a timeout — re-dispatch with a
   larger bound or a smaller unit, not an identical retry.

## Rule of thumb — which channel

| Waiting on… | Poll | Why |
|---|---|---|
| A teammate's ruling/verdict (β, Director) | signal board `wait <topic>` | rulings are posted; beats inbox-batching latency |
| A dispatched worker's output | completion ledger / `gauntlet-verify` | narration lies; the record is ground truth |
| A single hard dependency | bounded foreground dispatch | simplest correct shape; no fan-out to overlap |

## Enforcer

The stall-adherence enforcer is `scripts/checks/epsilon-liveness.js` (WG-6): for
each stale outstanding subprocess it checks the completion ledger and flags an
idle-with-outstanding-work stall. The signal-board half is self-tested by
`scripts/teams/signal-board.test.js`. **Fold-back DONE (ED-071 / AC-17, SP-20260718-005):**
this fire-and-poll rewrite is now folded back into `epsilon.md` TEAMMATE STALL RULES and the
`agent-dispatch-guide.md` cross-reference (both upgraded from the old blunt "never go idle" form
and both cite this file as the canonical source of record). The prior WG-29 enforcement-debt is
closed by that fold-back.

## Coordination cadence & handoff (session 2026-07-18/19 lessons)

Three behavioral rules that extend fire-and-poll — cheap levers that the not-yet-landed
structural fixes (the Phase-3 awaited-dispatch watchdog, the ED-228 conductor lease) do
not yet cover. Doctrine only; artifact-first re-wake (above) stays the method — never reap
on silence.

**Adaptive watchdog cadence — retune after the SECOND stall of a class.** A fixed 20-min
poll interval ate ~1.5–2h of dead wait across 9+ dropped re-wakes before it was tightened
to 6 min. A recurring stall class costs `interval/2 × occurrences`; match the cadence to the
actual work-unit duration (reviewer lanes run 2–9 min → a 6-min probe, not 20). The trigger
is the second stall of the same class in a session — one stall is noise, two is a cadence
signal. (Learning #125, 2026-07-18/19; sharpens F1 wake-notification-seam.)

**Receipt-confirmation for load-bearing orders — batching guarantees delivery-on-next-yield,
NOT delivery-before-a-relief.** Inbox batching (`[[project_teammate_inbox_batches_not_drops]]`)
delivers on the recipient's next yield and loses nothing — but an idle/relieved/committed
teammate never yields, so a verdict can land after its consumer is gone. For a load-bearing
order or verdict: confirm receipt explicitly ("confirm WO2 received") or watch for the
acting-on-it signal. When a verdict lands AFTER its consumer was relieved or committed, the
**orchestrator** owns folding it durably into the tracked plan (the ED-221 durability lesson,
applied live). (Learning #129, 2026-07-18/19.)

**Conductor-relief protocol (behavioral spec for the ED-228 lease).** Relieving an in-flight
conductor cleanly, three times this session with zero collisions (vs the 2026-07-18 morning
conductor-collision), took: (1) relieve with **explicit terms** — a no-fire order + read-only
reference + a **named** successor; (2) spawn the fresh conductor; (3) forward the predecessor's
load-bearing notes. Honor a conductor's own **context-depth self-report immediately** — a deep-context
flag is the cheapest collision predictor. This is the behavioral spec the durable mechanism must
encode: a lease/claim-file on an atomic-FS primitive (O_EXCL / atomic rename + a monotonic fencing
token), NOT a start-time guard, which is insufficient
(`[[project_settable_label_identity_and_conductor_lease]]`). Mechanism tracked as **ED-228**.
