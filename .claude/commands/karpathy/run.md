description: Karpathy autoresearch loop — plan a closed-loop experiment, review, then run autonomously in an isolated worktree. Optimize any editable artifact (agent spec, skill, hook policy) against a scalar metric.
---

# /karpathy:run — Autoresearch Loop

Runs a Karpathy-style `propose → execute → evaluate → select` loop against any editable artifact in the project, isolated inside a git worktree so the live codebase is never touched until explicit integration.

**Two phases. One command.**

- **Phase A — Planning (interactive, ~30s):** interpret the description, infer the target + domain, generate fixtures, present a reviewable plan. Human approves before anything is written.
- **Phase B — Execution (autonomous, background):** materialize the worktree, run the loop, stream a structured log, auto-stop on budget / plateau / mode-collapse / evaluator-lock violation.

Nothing merges into `main` from this skill. Use `/karpathy:integrate <run-id>` for that.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` — a natural-language description of what to optimize. Examples:
- `make alpha spawn the right agents and use gauntlets properly`
- `improve the /check:all skill so it runs under 60s`
- `tune gamma's fix-dispatch to reduce wasted builder spawns`

If empty, read prior context. If still ambiguous, say so in Phase A's plan (don't ask the user).

## Phase 0 — Resolve paths

Every path must come from `paths.json`. Never hardcode.

```bash
PATHS_JSON=".claude/paths.json"
KARPATHY_BASE=$(node -e "console.log(JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('$PATHS_JSON','utf8')).karpathyRuns)")
EVENTS_FILE=$(node -e "console.log(JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('$PATHS_JSON','utf8')).eventsFile)")
PROJECT_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

All run artifacts live under `$KARPATHY_BASE/<run-id>/`. If `paths.karpathyRuns` changes, this skill follows.

## Phase A — Planning

### A.1 — Domain inference

From `$ARGUMENTS`, pick the closest domain template:

| If description mentions… | Domain | Target candidate |
|---|---|---|
| alpha spawning, agent dispatch, gauntlets | `team-dispatch` | `.claude/agents/00-alex/alpha.md` (rubric block) |
| skill ergonomics, skill clarity, skill wording | `skill-clarity` | `.claude/commands/<ns>/<name>.md` |
| hook policy, hook blocking, evaluator lock | `hook-policy` | `scripts/hooks/<name>.js` (policy block only) |
| agent spec (non-dispatch) | `agent-spec` | `.claude/agents/**/*.md` |
| everything else | `generic` | User must confirm target in plan |

Domain templates live at `$KARPATHY_BASE/_templates/<domain>/`. If missing, generate the domain's `scripts/prepare.js` + `scripts/score.js` + `fixtures/` scaffold inline.

### A.1.5 — Blind fixture generation — visible + holdout split (mandatory)

Fixtures are authored by **two separate sibling agents that cannot read the target file**. The split prevents both conflict-of-interest AND overfitting to a single fixture corpus the proposer can see during iteration.

**Sibling 1 — visible set** (proposer sees these via `program.md` during iteration): dispatch via the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: general-purpose`:

```
Blind VISIBLE fixture brief:
- Description: $ARGUMENTS
- Domain: <domain from A.1>
- Target file: <file path> — DO NOT READ. No Read/Grep/Glob against it or any referenced companion artifact.
- Domain rule space (inferred from description only): <bullet list of 3-6 rules the target should obey>

Your task:
1. For each of the <N_rules> rules, author EXACTLY FOUR fixture variants — canonical, paraphrase, adversarial, boundary. Total fixtures = 4 × N_rules.
2. Variant A (canonical): direct "walk me through rule X" prompt.
3. Variant B (paraphrase): same rule, different vocabulary — resists keyword-tuning.
4. Variant C (adversarial): user pressure to violate the rule; doctrine must refuse.
5. Variant D (boundary): edge case inside the rule's envelope.
6. Each fixture includes: {id, rule_tested, variant, prompt, expected_properties}.
7. `expected_properties` checks are mechanical only (regex / includes / count). NO LLM-judge.
8. `min_checks_passing` MUST equal the total number of checks (100% required — no lenient thresholds).
9. Each fixture must have ≥6 checks across ≥3 different check kinds (must_contain_all, must_contain_any, must_not_contain, regex_match, min_count, max_count).
10. Return JSON array. No preamble.
```

**Sibling 2 — holdout set** (proposer NEVER sees these; scored separately at final report to measure overfitting): dispatch via a SECOND independent `Agent` call:

```
Blind HOLDOUT fixture brief:
- Description: $ARGUMENTS
- Domain: <domain>
- Target file: <file path> — DO NOT READ.
- Domain rule space: <same as visible set>

Your task:
1. Author EXACTLY ONE fixture per rule (total = N_rules, typically 6).
2. Use SYNONYMS and INDIRECT scenarios the proposer is unlikely to keyword-tune toward — e.g., "process-level separation" instead of "worktree", "4th failure in a row" instead of "3 consecutive".
3. Same rubric: min_checks_passing = total_checks, ≥6 checks across ≥3 kinds.
4. At least one holdout fixture must use `min_count` with n ≥ 2 to force structural presence, not single-keyword presence.
5. Return JSON array. No preamble.
```

The returned fixtures populate the plan's fixture table unchanged. The main skill does NOT re-author them. If either sibling violates the "don't read target" rule (detectable via its tool-use log — `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` against the target path), abort and re-dispatch with a stricter prompt; if it violates twice, flag in the plan and ask the user to redirect.

Rationale:
- **Blind authorship** prevents the candidate doctrine's implementation details from leaking into what counts as passing (per deep-research findings on LLM-as-judge bias).
- **Visible + holdout split** surfaces overfitting. The proposer can see visible fixtures via `program.md` and will optimize toward them. Holdout generalization is the only signal that the proposer learned the *rules*, not the *phrases*.
- **Four variants per rule** (canonical + paraphrase + adversarial + boundary) prevents keyword-tuning — a single-variant corpus can be passed by stuffing the exact test phrases into the doctrine.

### A.2 — Assemble the plan

Write the plan to stdout for human review. Do NOT write any file yet. Schema:

```
# Karpathy Loop — Proposed Run

## Description (verbatim from user)
$ARGUMENTS

## Interpreted
- Run ID:    <YYYY-MM-DD>-<HHMMSS>-<domain>-<short-slug>   # seconds precision makes parallel runs collision-free
- Domain:    <inferred domain> (redirect if wrong)
- Target:    <file path + line range if a block, or whole file>

## Strategy
<one-paragraph program.md draft covering: what to optimize, the rules/invariants, the measurable metric. This paragraph IS the contract that governs the loop.>

## Fixtures (authored by TWO blind siblings — visible + holdout)

**Visible set** (proposer sees via `program.md`; 4 variants × N rules):
- Authored by general-purpose sibling agent; target file was NOT readable to it.
- fx-A-01-<rule>-canonical:  direct probe of rule
- fx-B-01-<rule>-paraphrase: same rule, different vocabulary
- fx-C-01-<rule>-adversarial: user pressure to violate; doctrine must refuse
- fx-D-01-<rule>-boundary:    edge case inside the rule's envelope
- ... (repeat 4 variants per rule, total = 4 × N_rules)

**Holdout set** (proposer NEVER sees; scored at final report to surface overfitting):
- Authored by a SECOND blind sibling with synonym / indirect-scenario emphasis.
- ho-01-<rule>: paraphrased scenario using different vocabulary than the visible set
- ... (one per rule)

Each fixture uses `min_checks_passing = total_checks` (100% required) with ≥6 checks across ≥3 kinds.

## Scalar metric (non-linear composite, soft-ceiling)

Default formula (override only with a `redirect:` justification):

```
score = core × cross_artifact × length_factor × trace_factor × entropy_factor

core                  = (visible_rule_pass_rate ^ 2)
                        × structural_integrity
                        × ((1 - contradiction_penalty) ^ 3)
cross_artifact        = (companion artifacts exist AND carry headings) ratio in [0..1]
length_factor         = max(0.5, 1 - max(0, (len - baseline_len) / baseline_len - 0.2))
                        # no penalty up to +20% growth; decays linearly; clamps at 0.5
trace_factor          = 1.0 if canonical dispatch trace section present and passes 5+ regex checks;
                        0.85 if present with 3-4 regex hits; 0.65 if present with <3; 0.5 if absent
entropy_factor        = 1 + 0.1 × (unique_nonblank_lines / total_nonblank_lines)
                        # soft-ceiling bonus; max ~1.1; prevents keyword stuffing
```

- **Non-linear penalties** (rpr², contra³) prevent keyword-stuffing: one forbidden phrase destroys the score even when everything else is perfect.
- **Length factor** caps bloat: the proposer can't pad the doctrine with every fixture phrase.
- **Entropy bonus** breaks the hard 1.0 ceiling; the proposer keeps iterating past "perfect" toward density, not repetition.
- **Cross-artifact** ensures the doctrine and its companion files stay in sync.
- **Holdout pass rate** is NOT in the score the proposer optimizes — it's reported separately as `generalization_gap = visible_pass_rate - holdout_pass_rate`. A gap > 0.15 is a flag for overfitting.

Scoring is **mechanical only — no LLM-judge.** All checks are regex / section-present / file-exists / count. Per the deep-research findings, LLM-as-judge is empirically biased and gameable; the scorer must be deterministic code.

## Budget
- Wall-clock per fixture: 5 min
- Nightly cost cap: $25
- Max iterations: 100
- Max total wall-clock: 6h
- Stop early on: score plateau (Δ<0.01 × 15 iters), mode-collapse flag, evaluator-lock violation

## Evaluator-lock (non-negotiable)
- Shadow agent `cwd` fenced to worktree only
- Worktree `.claude/settings.local.json` denylists: fixtures/, scripts/score.js, results.tsv, log.jsonl
- Branch name `karpathy-run/<run-id>` blocked from push by merge-guard

## Instrumentation
- Per-iter entry appended to `log.jsonl` (run dir, append-only)
- **Dual-write**: every iteration also emits an `autoresearch.experiment` event to `paths.eventsFile` (`.claude/project/events/events.jsonl`) so sleep cycles and `/learn:*` skills ingest autoresearch runs alongside regular work.

## Artifacts to be written (on approval)
- $KARPATHY_BASE/<run-id>/program.md
- $KARPATHY_BASE/<run-id>/config.yaml
- $KARPATHY_BASE/<run-id>/target/<file>
- $KARPATHY_BASE/<run-id>/fixtures/*.json
- $KARPATHY_BASE/<run-id>/scripts/{prepare.js,score.js}
- $KARPATHY_BASE/<run-id>/log.jsonl
- $KARPATHY_BASE/<run-id>/results.tsv

## Worktree
- Path: <project>/../<project>-karpathy-<run-id>
- Branch: karpathy-run/<run-id> (off current HEAD)
- Cleanup on completion: keep until `/karpathy:integrate` or `/karpathy:discard`

## Cost estimate
~$<low>-$<high>, ~<N> iterations, ~<h>h wall-clock

## Approve gate (plan-is-contract)

This plan is the contract. Nothing materializes until you respond with one of:

- `Y` — full run with iter-1 pause (default, safest)
- `dry-run` — materialize worktree + scripts + fixtures, then stop; you inspect on disk before any iteration
- `no-pause` — skip the iter-1 sanity pause (use only for repeat configs you already trust)
- `redirect: <direction>` — re-plan with the new direction; can edit fixtures (`redirect: tighten fixture 04: …`), budget, target, domain
- `cancel` — abort, no worktree created

Respond with one of: `Y` | `dry-run` | `no-pause` | `redirect: <direction>` | `cancel`
```

Present the plan. Wait for user response. Accept:
- `Y` or `approve` — proceed to Phase B, auto-pilot to iteration 1, then pause.
- `dry-run` — proceed to Phase B through B.3.5 only (materialize worktree + scripts + fixtures, no iterations). User inspects on disk, then says `go` or `abort`.
- `no-pause` — proceed to Phase B without the iter-1 pause. Use only when user has already run this exact config before and trusts the pipeline.
- `redirect: <direction>` — re-plan with the new direction (including fixture tweaks, domain corrections, budget changes, etc.).
- `cancel` — write a `karpathy.run_cancelled` event to `$EVENTS_FILE` and stop.

## Phase B — Execution

### B.1 — Materialize the worktree

```bash
RUN_ID="<generated>"
WORKTREE_PATH="$PROJECT_ROOT/../$(basename $PROJECT_ROOT)-karpathy-$RUN_ID"
BRANCH="karpathy-run/$RUN_ID"

git worktree add -b "$BRANCH" "$WORKTREE_PATH"
mkdir -p "$KARPATHY_BASE/$RUN_ID"/{target,fixtures,scripts,history}
```

### B.2 — Write the run dir

Snapshot the target file, write the generated fixtures, scripts, `config.yaml`, `program.md`, initialize `log.jsonl` + `results.tsv`. Every write lives inside `$WORKTREE_PATH/$KARPATHY_BASE/$RUN_ID/` — **not the main checkout**.

### B.3 — Evaluator-lock enforcement

Inside the worktree only, write `.claude/settings.local.json` with a deny allowlist for the shadow agent:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(<KARPATHY_BASE>/<RUN_ID>/fixtures/**)",
      "Read(<KARPATHY_BASE>/<RUN_ID>/scripts/score.js)",
      "Read(<KARPATHY_BASE>/<RUN_ID>/results.tsv)",
      "Read(<KARPATHY_BASE>/<RUN_ID>/log.jsonl)",
      "Edit(<KARPATHY_BASE>/<RUN_ID>/fixtures/**)",
      "Edit(<KARPATHY_BASE>/<RUN_ID>/scripts/**)"
    ]
  }
}
```

Merge-guard already blocks `karpathy-run/*` branches from push — confirm by `grep -q "karpathy-run" scripts/hooks/merge-guard.js`; if absent, add the pattern before launching.

### B.3.1 — Lock hygiene (gate — do not skip)

Before B.4 starts, verify the evaluator-lock is materially on disk. The lock is load-bearing for scorer integrity — if iter 1 runs without it, any score the run produces is suspect because the shadow agent could have read the fixtures or the scorer.

```bash
LOCK="$WORKTREE_PATH/.claude/settings.local.json"
test -s "$LOCK" || { echo "FATAL: evaluator-lock missing at $LOCK — refusing to start loop"; exit 1; }
grep -q "\"deny\"" "$LOCK" || { echo "FATAL: evaluator-lock has no deny block"; exit 1; }
grep -q "$RUN_ID/fixtures" "$LOCK" || { echo "FATAL: evaluator-lock does not name this run's fixtures"; exit 1; }
```

If any check fails, abort the run, emit `karpathy.lock_hygiene_failed` event, and leave the worktree intact for forensics. Do NOT proceed to B.4 — a missing lock silently invalidates the whole run, and saturated scores in such runs (e.g. a mechanical scorer that trivially passes iter 1) are indistinguishable from real saturation.

Observed precedent: run 2026-04-18-134737-agent-spec-redteam-scan skipped this step, jumped straight from worktree creation to iter 1, and saturated at 1.0 on first attempt. The score was valid in that case only because the proposer was the orchestrating agent itself (no separate shadow agent read the fixtures), but the class of failure the lock prevents — proposer peeks at scorer — was unguarded.

### B.3.2 — Scorer self-test on synthetic degenerates (gate — do not skip)

Before iter 1, the scorer itself must be validated against four synthetic inputs. This catches gameability bugs in 30 seconds instead of after 60 iters. A scorer that passes the wrong inputs will mislead the entire run.

Write to `$KARPATHY_BASE/$RUN_ID/history/selftest.json` the score from each of:

1. **Empty file** — score `<target>` when replaced with `""`. Expected: near-zero.
2. **Baseline** — score the unmodified target (already done as iter 0). Expected: "problem-shaped" — typically 0.05–0.60 depending on domain.
3. **Keyword blob** — concatenate every phrase from every fixture's `must_contain_all`/`must_contain_any`/`must_contain_phrase` into one flat file; score it. **Expected: NOT 1.0.** If this scores ≥ 0.9, the scorer is gameable — the proposer will trivially win by stuffing — ABORT the run and emit `karpathy.scorer_gameable` event with the keyword-blob score.
4. **Inverted rules** — take the baseline, flip every `must_contain`→`must_not_contain` semantic by systematically replacing refusal language with permissive language and removing canonical section headings. Expected: near-zero. If inverted scores higher than baseline, the scorer's sign is wrong — ABORT with `karpathy.scorer_inverted`.

Emit a summary line to `log.jsonl` regardless of pass/fail:
```json
{"event":"scorer_selftest","ts":"...","empty":<s>,"baseline":<s>,"keyword_blob":<s>,"inverted":<s>,"pass":<bool>,"failed_checks":[...]}
```

If ANY check fails the expected band, abort Phase B immediately, print the failure mode to stdout, and exit non-zero. The user must redesign fixtures or scorer before retrying. Do NOT proceed to iter 1 on a broken scorer — this is the single highest-ROI gate in the entire skill.

Rationale: the v1 oneshot-protocol run (2026-04-18-133213) would have scored 1.0 against the keyword-blob degenerate because its rubric was `min_checks_passing << total_checks` and every check was a substring match. The v2 rubric detects this immediately: `rule_pass_rate² × (1 − contra)³` collapses to near-zero when the blob has no structure. The self-test makes the difference visible before the loop burns budget.

### B.3.5 — Dry-run checkpoint (if `dry-run` mode)

If the user entered Phase B via `dry-run`, stop here. Print:

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  DRY RUN COMPLETE — nothing has iterated yet.

  Inspect on disk:
    Run dir:   $KARPATHY_BASE/<run-id>/
    Scripts:   $KARPATHY_BASE/<run-id>/scripts/{prepare.js,score.js}
    Fixtures:  $KARPATHY_BASE/<run-id>/fixtures/*.json
    Program:   $KARPATHY_BASE/<run-id>/program.md
    Worktree:  <worktree path>

  Read anything you want. Nothing has touched main. Nothing has been scored.

  Say `go` to start iterating, or `abort` to remove the worktree + run dir.
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Wait. On `go`, proceed to B.4. On `abort`, `git worktree remove --force <worktree>`, `git branch -D <branch>`, `rm -rf <run-dir>`, emit `karpathy.dry_run_aborted` event, done.

### B.4 — The loop (per iteration)

```
1. Read program.md + current target/<file> + last-N entries of log.jsonl
2. LLM proposes a diff to target/<file>
3. Apply diff, commit to branch with msg `iter <N>: <diff_summary>`
4. For each fixture:
   a. Spawn headless Claude in $WORKTREE_PATH with modified target
      (claude --print --session-id evo-<RUN>-fx-<K> --output-format stream-json)
   b. Pipe the fixture prompt
   c. Capture the stream-json trace
   d. Kill after per-fixture wall-clock cap
5. Run scripts/score.js across all fixture traces → composite scalar
6. Append log.jsonl entry + results.tsv row + emit autoresearch.experiment to $EVENTS_FILE
7. Decision:
   - Score > best? Keep (branch advances, new baseline)
   - Score ≤ best? git reset --hard to prior iter commit
8. If iter == 1 AND user did NOT pass `no-pause`: pause (see B.4.5).
9. Check stop conditions. If any fire, write final report and exit.
```

### B.4.5 — Pause after iter 1 (default; conditionally non-skippable)

After the first complete iteration, the runner pauses and prints a full trust-check dashboard. This is the moment to catch a miscalibrated scorer, a broken fixture harness, or an unexpected cost profile — before committing to ~80 more iters.

**The iter-1 pause is non-skippable — `no-pause` is REJECTED — when any of these hold** (even if the user passed `no-pause` in Phase A):

- `baseline_score > 0.5` on the scorer self-test's baseline measurement (the doctrine already partially satisfies the rubric — high risk that iter-1 lands at 1.0 and there's no signal)
- Fewer than 6 total fixtures OR fewer than 4 variants for any rule (corpus too thin to detect overfitting)
- Fixtures were authored by the same agent instance as the proposer would run in (leak risk)
- Holdout set is empty or has fewer than one fixture per rule
- `keyword_blob` score from B.3.2 self-test was > 0.6 (scorer looked gameable but didn't trip the abort gate)

If any of these conditions hold, the runner ignores `no-pause` and pauses regardless, printing the reason. User must type `go` or `abort` to proceed. This prevents users from bypassing safety on exactly the runs where it matters most.

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  PAUSE AFTER ITERATION 1 — sanity-check before continuing

  Score:          <score> (baseline: <baseline>)
  Wall-clock:     <s>s
  Cost (iter 1):  $<cost>
  Projected total @ max_iters: $<projected> / $<budget>

  Fixtures:       <N> run, <K> passed
  Per-fixture breakdown:
    <fixture-01>  pass  score=1.00  wall=<s>s
    <fixture-02>  fail  score=0.60  wall=<s>s  reason=<first failing check>
    …

  Flags:          <entropy_ok | entropy_dropped | cost_cap_Xpct | eval_lock_ok | …>

  Inspect:
    Log:           $KARPATHY_BASE/<run-id>/log.jsonl (line 1 + session_started)
    Fixture traces: <worktree>/.tmp/fixture-trace-*.jsonl
    Diff applied:  git -C <worktree> show HEAD

  Does this look right?
    `go`              — continue to iter 2..max
    `abort`           — stop, preserve run dir for forensics
    `redirect: <x>`   — re-plan (nothing committed yet; discards worktree)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Wait for response. This is the last hard stop before the loop auto-pilots.

### B.5 — Log schema (`log.jsonl`, append-only)

Every entry is one JSON object on its own line:

```json
{"ts":"2026-04-18T...","run_id":"...","iter":17,
 "variant_id":"v017-a3b9","parent_id":"v012-f2c1",
 "diff_hash":"sha256:...","diff_summary":"...",
 "fixtures_run":5,"fixtures_passed":4,"score":0.73,
 "best_so_far":0.68,"decision":"accepted",
 "tokens_in":12400,"tokens_out":3100,"cost_usd":0.04,
 "wall_clock_s":287,
 "flags":["entropy_ok","cost_cap_40pct"]}
```

Session-level entries (same file, distinguished by presence of `event` field):
`{"event":"run_started" | "run_stopped" | "budget_exceeded" | "mode_collapse_detected" | "evaluator_lock_violation" | ...}`

### B.6 — Entropy: stop-signal AND score component

Entropy plays two roles in v2+:

**As a stop signal (mode-collapse monitor):** after every iteration, compute trajectory entropy — bag-of-lines across the last 10 accepted diffs. If Shannon entropy drops below a domain-specific threshold (default: entropy < 0.3 × baseline), append `{"event":"mode_collapse_detected"}` and stop. Per the research: entropy drops *before* reward does; this is a leading indicator.

**As a score component (soft-ceiling reward):** the scorer's `entropy_factor = 1 + 0.1 × (unique_nonblank_lines / total_nonblank_lines)` gives up to +10% bonus for diverse prose. This pushes the max possible score above 1.0 (to ~1.1), so the proposer has headroom to iterate past a hard ceiling. It also actively rewards paraphrase over repetition — the exact opposite of keyword-stuffing.

Together, these prevent the failure mode where the optimizer converges on a dense low-entropy phrase blob: the factor rewards uniqueness; the monitor trips if the diff trajectory goes repetitive.

### B.6.5 — Reward-hacking detector (per-iter)

On every iteration, compute two additional safety checks:

1. **Generalization gap:** `gap = visible_pass_rate - holdout_pass_rate`. If `gap > 0.15` for ≥ 3 consecutive iterations, emit `{"event":"overfitting_detected","gap":<n>}` and stop — the proposer is learning visible-fixture phrases, not rules.
2. **Per-iter scorer re-validation:** periodically (every 10 iters) re-run the B.3.2 keyword-blob self-test against the latest target. If the blob-stuffed variant of the current target would now score ≥ 0.9, the scorer has drifted — emit `{"event":"scorer_drift_detected"}` and pause for user review.

Both checks are cheap (no extra LLM calls) and catch reward-hacking before the loop burns its full budget on a compromised metric.

### B.7 — Stop conditions (all hard-coded, enforced by runner — not trusted to the agent)

- Budget: wall-clock total > config.budget.wall_clock_hours × 3600s
- Budget: iters > config.budget.max_iters
- Budget: cumulative cost_usd > config.budget.cost_cap_usd
- Plateau: best_so_far unchanged for config.budget.plateau_iters iterations (default 15)
- Mode-collapse: entropy monitor fires (B.6)
- Evaluator-lock: any fixture trace shows a denied-path Read/Edit (fatal — abort and flag)
- Scorer self-test failure: B.3.2 keyword-blob ≥ 0.9 OR inverted > baseline (fatal — abort before iter 1)
- Overfitting: `gap > 0.15` for ≥ 3 consecutive iters (B.6.5)
- Scorer drift: mid-run keyword-blob re-check scores ≥ 0.9 (B.6.5)
- User: `$KARPATHY_BASE/$RUN_ID/.stop` file exists (touch-to-stop)

### B.8 — Final report

```

## Constraints (non-negotiable)

1. **Never touch the main checkout.** All mutations inside the worktree. Integration is a separate verb.
2. **Every path from `paths.json`.** No literal `docs/99-resources/...` anywhere. Resolve at runtime.
3. **No LLM-judge scoring.** Only mechanical scorers (events.jsonl inspection, diff matching, exit codes, counters). Per the research, LLM-as-judge is biased and gameable.
4. **Wall-clock cap per fixture is mandatory.** Step caps are insufficient — they miss infinite-call loops (the research is explicit).
5. **Evaluator-lock before first experiment runs.** If the agent being tested can see the scorer, scores are meaningless.
6. **Trajectory entropy monitored.** Mode collapse is a leading indicator that saves real budget.
7. **Dual-write to `paths.eventsFile`.** Per-experiment events into the main audit log. Sleep cycles ingest them automatically.
8. **Plan is the contract.** Nothing materializes without Phase A approval.
9. **Blind holdout split mandatory.** Two siblings (visible + holdout), no exceptions. Generalization gap is the only signal that the proposer learned rules, not phrases.
10. **`min_checks_passing = total_checks` by default.** Lenient thresholds make fixtures trivially passable; opt-out requires a justification in the fixture JSON.
11. **≥4 fixture variants per rule.** Canonical + paraphrase + adversarial + boundary. A single-variant corpus can be passed by keyword-stuffing.
12. **Non-linear score composite.** Default metric cubes the contradiction penalty and squares the pass rate. Flat multiplication is gameable — a single forbidden phrase must wreck the score.
13. **Length factor mandatory for text targets.** File growth past +20% vs baseline degrades score. Prevents phrase-stuffing bloat.
14. **Scorer self-test before iter 1.** Empty / baseline / keyword-blob / inverted degenerates must score in-band. A gameable scorer aborts the run BEFORE the loop burns budget (B.3.2).
15. **Reward-hacking detection runs every iter.** Gen-gap and mid-run scorer re-validation catch overfitting and scorer drift (B.6.5).
16. **Soft-ceiling via entropy bonus.** Max score > 1.0 (~1.1) so the proposer has headroom to iterate past a hard ceiling and is actively rewarded for paraphrase over repetition.

## Parallel runs (supported)

Multiple `/karpathy:run` invocations can execute concurrently across different Claude Code terminals without interference, provided the run-ID generation includes HHMMSS (see A.2 schema above). Safety is structural, not coordinated — each run owns its own worktree, branch, run dir, `log.jsonl`, and `results.tsv`; no shared mutable state.

- **Run IDs:** `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<HHMMSS>-<domain>-<slug>` — seconds precision makes collisions require sub-second simultaneous plan approvals, which is effectively impossible for interactive use. If it happens anyway, `git worktree add` will refuse the second collision and the skill aborts cleanly with a diagnostic; re-run and the new HHMMSS resolves it.
- **Shared `events.jsonl`:** append-only JSONL with O_APPEND semantics is atomic for writes < 4KB (all autoresearch events are well under this cap). Multiple runs can safely dual-write concurrently.
- **Shared `merge-guard.js` hook:** stateless — fires per tool call, no cross-run contention.
- **Worktree directories:** live outside the main checkout (`<project>/..`). Each run occupies a distinct path by construction.
- **Branches:** each run owns `karpathy-run/<run-id>`. No push happens (merge-guard blocks), so no remote collision either.
- **Headless `claude --print` fixture dispatches:** each spawns its own session ID. No inter-session state.
- **Cost accounting:** per-run budget is independent. Running N runs in parallel burns N× the per-run rate — this is the user's responsibility, not the skill's.

**What is NOT safely parallel:**
- `/karpathy:integrate <run-id>` — only one at a time, because integration mutates the main-checkout working tree. Running two integrates concurrently on the same repo will race.
- Concurrent runs targeting the **same target file**. Each can still complete independently, but whichever integrates first wins, and the second must rebase or be discarded. The skill doesn't prevent this; it's a user-level coordination problem (the worktree boundary means no live-checkout conflicts during iteration — the issue only surfaces at integrate time).

**Discovery across terminals:** `/karpathy:status` (no args) lists the most recently modified run under `paths.karpathyRuns`. To see all currently-running runs: `ls -lt $(paths.karpathyRuns)` sorts them by last activity. Run-IDs are the canonical handle — pass one to `/karpathy:status <run-id>` from any terminal to inspect that run's state without side effects.
