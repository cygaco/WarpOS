description: Report-only plan-lint — flags any plan artifact under _planning/epics/** (optionally _planning/plans/**) that omits a principle-required section: a named enforcer, proof/acceptance, or a blast-radius assessment. The named enforcer for the planning principles (_planning/principle.md), E-LIFECYCLE-001 §8.11. Fail-open; never blocks.

# /scan:planning-principles — Planning-principles plan-lint

The named enforcer for `_planning/principle.md` (S-LC-08 / E-LIFECYCLE-001 §8.11).
The planning principles say every plan must name an **enforcer** per policy (#7),
state its **proof / acceptance** (#6/#15), and assess its **blast radius** (#5). This
scan makes a plan that OMITS any of those three self-detecting — closing the
"principles live only in a prompt, nothing checks them" gap.

## What it does

```
node scripts/checks/planning-principles.js [--json] [--include-plans] [--planning-dir <path>]
```

- Walks the lifecycle-store epic plan artifacts (`_planning/epics/**`). `--include-plans`
  also scans `_planning/plans/**` (the separate org/GTM expansion corpus — opt-in).
- For each plan `.md` (the dir-contract `README.md` is excluded), checks the body for the
  three principle-required sections:
  - **enforcer** — `enforcer` / `enforced by`
  - **proof / acceptance** — `proof` / `required-proof` / `acceptance` / `verified by`
  - **blast-radius** — `blast radius` / `blast-radius`
- A doc missing one or more → a finding naming the file + which sections are absent.
- `--planning-dir <path>` points the scan at a fixture tree (used by the regression test).
- `--json` emits a machine envelope (`{ ok, check, counts:{docs,gaps}, findings[] }`).

## Exit codes

- `0` — **always** (REPORT-ONLY this wave, §8.11 "report-only first"). Gaps are printed,
  never blocking. **FAIL-OPEN:** a missing planning dir, an unreadable file, or any internal
  error degrades to a clean exit 0 with a note — an advisory plan-lint must never break a
  scan or a build.

The `--enforce` ramp-to-blocking tail is a later flip behind operator sign-off (the same
ramp pattern as `/scan:coverage-gate` and the mode-lifecycle coverage enforcers).

## Pairs with

- `_planning/principle.md` — the 17 canonical planning principles this lints against.
- `_planning/README.md` — the lifecycle-store contract (subdirs, tracker-linkage, ship boundary).
- `/sprint:plan` + the (planned) `/epic:plan` — the producers of the plan artifacts this scans.
- Wired report-only into `/scan:full` (Dispatch-shape integrity block).
