description: Report the turbo session's REAL cross-provider API spend against the operator-set ceiling (framework default $100, runtime-raisable), and assert the turbo permission-profile honesty invariant (push-to-main = confirm, never auto/notice). Report-only for spend; fail-open on a ledger fault. A NEW scan, separate from /scan:full.

# /scan:turbo-spend — Turbo spend ledger + profile honesty

The turbo-hardening backstop (S-LC-07). Two surfaces in one report:

1. **Spend ledger (REPORT-ONLY).** Sums the REAL paid cross-provider dispatcher
   calls (`scripts/dispatch-agent.js` → GPT / Gemini, recorded in
   `paths.dispatchCompletionsFile`) for the session and compares the estimated
   total against the resolved ceiling. The ceiling is **source-vs-instance**
   (P-058): the runtime override in `authorization.json` (`spend_ceiling_usd`,
   this session $500) when present+valid, **else the framework default $100** —
   never a hardcoded instance value. Budget-approach warnings (≥80%) and
   under-budget notices are emitted but NEVER block. The real gates are the
   **$5/op CLAUDE.md autonomy line** and the **operator session ceiling**.

2. **Profile honesty (HAS TEETH).** Validates the `auto / notice / confirm / never`
   permission profile (`scripts/turbo/permission-profile.js`). **push-to-main is
   `confirm` — never `auto`/`notice`** because the harness auto-mode classifier
   sits ABOVE `permissions.allow` (PROVEN 2026-06-09). A profile that claims
   auto-push is a dishonest overclaim (P-061) → HARD finding (exit 1). The
   preflight consistency leg cross-checks the profile against the proven
   classifier mapping (`scripts/turbo/classifier-preflight.js`).

> Intentionally NOT part of `/scan:full` — S-LC-06 owns `full.md` this wave
> (β: avoid the S-LC-06 collision). This is a standalone, opt-in scan.

## What it does

```
node scripts/checks/turbo-spend.js [--json] [--profile <file>]
```

- Default: validates the CANONICAL profile + reports session spend.
- `--profile <file>`: validate a candidate profile JSON (a planted auto-push
  profile is flagged → exit 1).
- `--json`: machine envelope.

## Exit codes

- `0` — spend reported; profile honest (the normal path). **Spend state NEVER
  drives a non-zero exit** (report-only).
- `1` — a profile honesty / hard-ceiling violation was found (e.g. an auto-push
  overclaim, a lifted hard ceiling, or a profile inconsistent with the proven
  classifier mapping).

A malformed / absent ledger is **fail-open** (exit 0) — a ledger fault must never
stall the build.

## Pairs with

- `scripts/turbo/spend-ledger.js` — the report-only spend ledger + ceiling resolution.
- `scripts/turbo/permission-profile.js` — the explicit `auto/notice/confirm/never` scope→level table + honesty validator.
- `scripts/turbo/classifier-preflight.js` — the live classifier preflight mapping (which scopes the harness classifier honors vs gates per-action).
- `scripts/turbo/apply.js` + `scripts/hooks/authorization-gate.js` — the turbo grant + the PreToolUse authorization gate.
- `.claude/agents/president/_system/policy/decision-policy.md` § "Autonomy-ceiling resolution" — the operator's 2026-06-09 turbo ruling.
