description: Bidirectional coverage of the sprint hook-point registry — FORWARD (every matched block-row has a manager_consult record per /sprint:full run) + REVERSE (registry structurally coherent against role-registry)

# /scan:sprint-hook-coverage

The bidirectional coverage enforcer for the **sprint hook-point registry** (`.claude/agents/_org/sprint-hook-points.json`) — Phase D F3c. The "easily find gaps" mechanism the operator asked for ("a hook point for each step, so as we add agents they can be easily wired in, and we can easily find gaps"), made self-detecting on the agent↔sprint surface. Generalizes the single-manager `/scan:sprint-manager-consult` to the whole registry.

Runs `scripts/checks/sprint-hook-coverage.js`.

## The two directions

**FORWARD (per `/sprint:full` run).** For every hook-point row whose `condition` MATCHED the run's composition with `mode: "block"`, a `manager_consult` record for that role must exist over the run window — else `missing_block_agent` (a required agent declared at a step never ran). Advisory rows that matched but didn't run are reported as **info**, not findings (e.g. `design-quality`'s W1 advisory ramp).

**REVERSE (static, registry-only).** The registry is structurally coherent — every row's `role` exists in `role-registry.json`, every `step` is a canonical lifecycle step, and no step is orphaned. Delegates to `scripts/sprint/hook-points.js` `validate()` (the same tripwire its own test asserts). A structurally-broken registry is **fail-closed (exit 2)** regardless of runs.

## Composition + records

- The run's **composition** `{ unit_types, max_risk, domains }` is derived from the sprint's ticket files (`paths.sprintTickets`) — the same source `full.js` feeds the router — via `hook-points.js#compositionFromTickets`.
- The **`manager_consult` records** are emitted by `scripts/sprint/hook-consult.js` (`emitStepConsults`), wired into `full.js`'s phase loop (`emitPhaseConsults`), one per engaged agent per step. Shape: `{ manager, mode, unit, verdict, phase, hook_mode }` with `sprint_id` on the event.

## Date-cutoff + graceful

- Sprints whose start date is **before `2026-06-05`** (the F3b emitter wiring date) are exempt (legacy — flagging them is a false positive). Override with `--since <ISO>`.
- Synthetic sprints (`SP-J*`, `SP-TEST*`), undated sprints, and sprints with no attributed `/sprint:full` run are exempt.
- **Graceful-empty:** no applicable post-cutoff runs → exit 0 (the registry is still validated). **Fail-closed:** a bad `--since`, or an unreadable/incoherent registry → exit 2.

## Exit codes

- `0` — registry coherent + 0 forward gaps (or nothing applicable to audit).
- `1` — ≥1 forward coverage gap (a matched block-row with no consult record).
- `2` — fail-closed (bad `--since`, unreadable/structurally-broken registry).

## Output

`--json` emits `{ ok, applicable, checked, findings[], info, totalFindings, cutoff }`. Default is a human summary; a FAIL lists the gaps.

## Bite-test

`node scripts/checks/test-sprint-hook-coverage.js` — proves forward gap detection, the exemptions (pre-cutoff / synthetic / undated / no-run), advisory-as-info, and reverse coherence (the real registry passes; a broken one fails).
