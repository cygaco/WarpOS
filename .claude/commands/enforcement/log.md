# /enforcement:log — Log Aspirational Policy

Record a rule, convention, contract, or invariant that exists in writing but has no mechanism that detects violations. Closes the aspirational-vs-enforced gap at write-time so the pattern stops repeating one sprint at a time.

## When to use

Invoke this any time you write or notice a policy that says "X must always (or never) happen" — in a skill body, doc, hook spec, agent prompt, CLAUDE.md, ADR, PRD, agent contract — and you can't name a mechanism that makes a violation self-detecting.

Enforcers are mechanism-agnostic. A valid enforcer is *anything* that produces a loud signal on violation:
- Hook (pre/post-tool, pre/post-commit)
- Test (unit, integration, regression, fixture)
- Schema validator (JSON-schema, YAML, types)
- CI check (gate, lint, build refusal)
- Agent contract clause (compliance/reviewer rule)
- Script that exits non-zero
- Telemetry signal someone actually reads
- Release gate

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` — natural-language description. The skill parses it for:

- `policy` *(required)* — one-line summary of what should always (or never) happen
- `source` *(required)* — where the policy lives (file path, skill name, doc heading, ADR id)
- `missing_enforcer` — kind of mechanism that would fit best (hook, test, schema, ci-check, agent-contract, release-gate, telemetry-read, none-yet-decided)
- `candidate_enforcers` — list of mechanisms that could close the gap (free-form strings)
- `severity` — `low` | `medium` | `high` (default: `medium`)
- `note` — free-form context, related learning IDs, links

If any required field is missing from the natural-language input, ask once for the minimum (`policy` + `source`).

## Steps

1. Resolve `paths.enforcementDebt` (`.claude/project/memory/enforcement-debt.jsonl`). If the file does not exist, create it empty.
2. Get the next id by running `node scripts/enforcement/next-ed-id.js` (prints `ED-NNN` = the true max existing ED id + 1, malformed-line-safe). Do **NOT** count lines — append-only closure/amendment rows inflate the line count above the id count, so line-count minting re-issues a live id (ED-267b: the register is 141 lines but the max id is ED-269). The genesis-keyed `scripts/enforcement/ed-dup-id-lint.js` (in `/scan:full`) is the backstop if a collision slips in anyway.
3. Build the record. Required keys: `id`, `ts` (ISO 8601 UTC), `policy`, `source`, `severity`, `status: "open"`. Optional: `missing_enforcer`, `candidate_enforcers` (array), `note`.
4. Append the JSON record as a single line to `paths.enforcementDebt`.
5. Echo back: `Logged ED-NNN. Policy: <short summary>. Severity: <s>. Status: open.`

## Status taxonomy

- `open` — debt is live; no enforcer ships yet.
- `enforced` — a mechanism now detects violations. Resolve via direct JSONL edit: change `status` to `enforced` and add `enforced_by` (reference to the enforcer — hook path, test name, agent rule, etc.) + `enforced_at` (ISO date).
- `retired` — the policy itself was retired; no longer load-bearing. Set `status: "retired"` and add `retired_reason`.

## Anti-patterns

- **Don't auto-promote.** Logging debt is not approval to ship without an enforcer. It's a record that you noticed. The right next move is still to enforce; logging just stops the gap from disappearing.
- **Don't log noise.** Style preferences, formatting, taste calls — not policies. A policy has a violation case that produces a real bad outcome (lost work, drift, broken consumer, silent regression). If the worst case is "code looks slightly different," skip.
- **Don't enumerate exhaustively.** Better to log the 5 highest-severity gaps and act on them than to log 50 and act on none.
- **A comment stating the invariant is not an enforcer of it.** "These two sites must share one transform" written as a code comment detects nothing; S-VLADW1-04 shipped exactly that comment, implemented the fold beside the shared transform instead of inside it, and nothing noticed. If you catch yourself writing the invariant into prose next to the code, either make the divergence self-detecting (one shared call site, a test that fails on the fork) or log the debt here — those are the only two honest endings.
- **A "clean" enforcer that enumerated zero candidates must report UNKNOWN.** Zero findings over zero inputs is not a pass (**ED-366**).

## Before you accept an enforcer as closing the debt

Three failure modes that make an enforcer look green while the gap stays open. Check each before flipping `status: "enforced"`:

1. **Coverage derived from a shape predicate must REFUSE near-misses, not skip them.** A regex/AST match over the artifact it protects silently narrows the population it judges, and the gate then reports success over the narrowed set. Pair every derived-coverage enforcer with a committed near-miss mutation battery (variant dashes/colons/indent/spacing/casing) that goes RED when the predicate narrows. Watching the enforcer catch one real case is confirmation, not coverage (**ED-358**; the full discipline is `paths.reference`/`reasoning-frameworks.md` § *Confirmation is not coverage*).
2. **A text-matching enforcer cannot tell a violation from a description of one.** Prose written ABOUT the banned pattern trips the ban — including the doc explaining the enforcer and this ledger entry. Document the trap in the scanner's OWN header so the next author meets it in the code rather than at a red gate.
3. **State the enforcer's coverage at the grain it actually has.** "Covers the two scripts" over a letter-level sample is a false coverage claim in the debt record itself. Name the enumerated unit; never a count.
