# /sprint:execute — Sprint Execute

Run approved tickets through governed Ralph loops. Each ticket goes
through: plan → act → test → review → record → checkpoint → repeat-or-stop.
Progress is persisted to files so a crash or context reset can resume.

`/sprint:execute` is **execution**, not planning. It refuses to invent
work outside the approved tickets and stops at approval boundaries,
external-service blocks, repeated failures, scope expansion, and
production-deploy needs.

## When to use

- Tickets exist with status `ready_for_execution` (or `in_progress`
  resumed after a crash).
- Plan Contract approvals are satisfied.
- ESDs for the relevant phase are `ready_for_terminal_work`, `mocked`,
  `integrated`, or explicitly `deferred`.

## Inputs

```text
/sprint:execute [--ticket <T-id>] [--sprint <SP-id>] [--allow-overlap]
```

- `--ticket <T-id>` — execute one specific ticket. If omitted, pick the
  first ticket in the targeted sprint's `ready_for_execution` bucket.
- `--sprint <SP-id>` (v0.2) — target a specific sprint. Defaults to
  `paths.sprintActiveRegistry#primary`. Unknown id → exit non-zero
  with COPY C-10.
- `--allow-overlap` (v0.2) — proceed even when
  `scripts/sprint/conflict-check.js` reports `affected_surfaces`
  overlap with another live sprint. The override is logged to
  `paths.decisionLedger` with reason `manual_allow_overlap`.

If the target sprint has `lane.type === "worktree"`, Ralph phases run
inside the lane's git worktree (the sprint's `lane.value`). The first
agent dispatch fires a no-op warm-up agent first to dodge the
`first-parallel-dispatch leaks to main repo HEAD` issue
(LRN-2026-04-17, see `_docs/sprint/LANES.md`).

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Pre-flight

```bash
node scripts/sprint/external-service.js gate --phase execute
```

If the gate fails, halt. Surface the offending ESDs and exit. Do NOT
proceed to ticket execution.

### Step 2 — Pick a ticket

Read `paths.sprintCurrent`. Pick a ticket from `ready_for_execution`
(or honor `--ticket`). Move it to `in_progress`:

```bash
node scripts/sprint/ticket.js update --id <T-id> --status in_progress --owner-agent alpha
```

### Step 3 — Start the Ralph loop

```bash
node scripts/sprint/execute.js start --ticket <T-id> \
  --tasks "task A;task B;task C" \
  --next-action "Plan the smallest next change for <T-id>."
```

This creates `paths.sprintRalph/<sprint>/<ticket>.yaml` in phase `plan`,
loop 1.

### Step 4 — Run the Ralph loop

Each loop:

1. **plan** — read the ticket; pick ONE coherent next task; write the
   intended change as a tiny plan.
2. **act** — make the smallest meaningful change.
3. **test** — run relevant checks (lint, typecheck, unit tests). Use
   `--add-passing`/`--add-failing` on the phase update to record
   results.
4. **review** — does the change match the ticket and requirements?
   Does it satisfy COPY, INPUTS, TRACE, acceptance criteria, ESD
   constraints, and QA expectations? If not, note what's missing.
5. **record** — update the ticket (status, evidence, fix attempts).
   Update the requirements files if behavior diverged from spec.
6. **checkpoint** — write a checkpoint via `scripts/sprint/checkpoint.js`
   AND advance the Ralph file via `execute.js phase --phase checkpoint`.
7. **repeat or stop** — if remaining tasks exist and no stop condition
   was hit, loop. Otherwise stop.

Phase transitions:

```bash
node scripts/sprint/execute.js phase --ticket <T-id> --phase act \
  --note "Started implementing X"
node scripts/sprint/execute.js phase --ticket <T-id> --phase test \
  --add-passing "lint;typecheck" --add-failing "unit-tests:X"
node scripts/sprint/execute.js phase --ticket <T-id> --phase review \
  --note "AC-1.1 satisfied; AC-1.2 missing"
node scripts/sprint/execute.js phase --ticket <T-id> --phase record
node scripts/sprint/execute.js phase --ticket <T-id> --phase checkpoint \
  --next-action "Next loop: address AC-1.2."
```

### Step 5 — Stop conditions

Halt the Ralph loop and call `execute.js stop` when any of these
trigger:

| Condition | Stop reason |
|---|---|
| Ticket meets all AC; tests pass | `completed` |
| Approval required | `stopped_approval_required` |
| Human setup / signup required | `stopped_human_setup_required` |
| 3+ failed attempts on the same fix | `stopped_repeated_failure` |
| Scope is expanding beyond the ticket | `stopped_scope_expansion` |
| Destructive action needed | `stopped_destructive_action_needed` |
| Production deploy needed | `stopped_production_deploy_needed` |
| Beta predicts user rejection | `stopped_beta_warning` |
| Intent is unclear (re-plan needed) | `stopped_unclear_intent` |

```bash
node scripts/sprint/execute.js stop --ticket <T-id> \
  --reason <reason> --notes "<what's needed next>"
```

After `completed`, update the ticket:

```bash
node scripts/sprint/ticket.js update --id <T-id> --status in_review \
  --add-evidence "tests/<path>.spec.ts passing; PR #N"
```

### Step 6 — Log issues found

Any bug, regression, or edge case discovered mid-loop is recorded:

```bash
node scripts/sprint/issue.js create \
  --title "<short>" \
  --severity <low|medium|high|critical> \
  --source <test_failure|qa_finding|redteam_finding|agent_observation> \
  --expected "<expected>" \
  --actual "<actual>" \
  --related-ticket <T-id>
```

Promote an issue to a new ticket if it requires its own scoped work:

```bash
node scripts/sprint/issue.js promote --id <I-id> --to-ticket-type bug
```

### Step 7 — 3-attempt rule

If a fix on the same bug fails 3+ times:

1. Stop brute-forcing.
2. Each attempt is already logged via
   `execute.js phase --add-failed-attempt "<approach>"`.
3. Mark the issue `deferred` (or `abandoned` if non-blocking) unless
   the issue blocks the sprint objective.
4. If it blocks the sprint, escalate via `/fix:deep`.

This matches the existing rule in CLAUDE.md and the bug helpers.

### Step 8 — Checkpoint discipline

Write a checkpoint at minimum:

- after each Ralph loop completes
- before each ticket starts
- when an issue is discovered
- when an approval boundary is hit
- when external service setup is required
- when scope expands (and the run halts)
- before final report

```bash
node scripts/sprint/checkpoint.js \
  --sprint <sprint-id> \
  --phase execute \
  --command /sprint:execute \
  --status running \
  --ticket <T-id> \
  --loop <n> \
  --next-action "<plain English>" \
  --resume-command "/sprint:execute --ticket <T-id>" \
  --resume-notes "Loop <n>, phase <p>. Next: <text>." \
  --safe-to-continue true
```

### Step 9 — Final execution report

When the sprint's ready_for_execution queue is empty (or you stop
intentionally), write a one-page execution report. The simplest form:
update `paths.sprintCurrent.reports.execution` to point at a markdown
file you draft summarizing tickets completed, issues resolved/deferred,
checks results, and learning candidates.

## Outputs

| Artifact | Path |
|---|---|
| Ralph progress | `paths.sprintRalph/<sprint>/<ticket>.yaml` |
| Ticket updates | `paths.sprintTickets/<T-id>.yaml` |
| Issue records | `paths.sprintIssues/<I-id>.yaml` + `paths.sprintIssuesLedger` |
| Checkpoints | `paths.sprintProgress` + `paths.sprintCheckpoints/<sprint>-<n>.yaml` |
| Current sprint | `paths.sprintCurrent` (tickets, ralph, crash_recovery updated) |

## Recovery

Crash mid-loop:

1. Read `paths.sprintProgress`. The `current_ticket`, `current_loop`,
   `current_phase`, and `next_action` fields tell you where you were.
2. Read `paths.sprintRalph/<sprint>/<ticket>.yaml` for the loop's full
   state.
3. If `status` is `stopped_*`, **investigate** the `stop_reason` before
   resuming.
4. Resume by re-running `/sprint:execute --ticket <T-id>` and advancing
   the phase from where you left off (`execute.js phase`).

## Approval gates

- Any ticket with `approval_required: true` halts the loop until the
  approval record exists.
- ESDs with `approval_required: true` halt the loop until approved.
- Production deploy is never automated. `/sprint:execute` halts; the
  user invokes `/sprint:release`.

## Routing

Per `paths.sprintRouting`:
- `execution.model_class` = `economical_coder`
- `execution.escalate_to` = `strong_reasoning` (on repeated failure or
  architecture-touching tickets)
- `qa.diff_review` = `true`
- `redteam.diff_review` = `true`

## Relationship to existing modes

`/sprint:execute` is mode-aware:

- **Solo:** Alpha runs the loop directly.
- **Adhoc:** Alpha runs the loop. Gamma is invoked when a ticket needs
  a build/gauntlet cycle (existing Gamma flow). Sprint progress is the
  durable record; team-task ownership is ephemeral.
- **Oneshot:** Not the intended path. Oneshot is a standalone skeleton
  rebuild; sprint v0.1 does NOT auto-invoke it. If a sprint genuinely
  needs an oneshot rebuild, halt sprint execution, run
  `/mode:oneshot`, and re-enter sprint when complete.

The sprint tracker is the source of truth for what's done, regardless
of mode. Team tasks are NEVER used as the durable record.
