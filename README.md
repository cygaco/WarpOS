# WarpOS

An AI operating system for Claude Code. It gives you a team of AI agents that plan, build, review, and learn — so you can focus on what matters.

**Platform:** Windows only (for now)
**Version:** 0.1.0

## What Is This?

You know how using Claude Code feels like talking to a smart colleague? WarpOS turns that colleague into a full team.

Instead of one assistant, you get:
- **An architect** that plans what to build and in what order
- **A judgment model** that catches bad decisions before they cost you time
- **A builder** that writes code in isolated branches so your main code stays clean
- **Reviewers** that automatically check every build for bugs, security issues, and spec compliance

Plus **66 skills** (commands you can run like `/fix:fast` or `/research:deep`), **25 automated hooks** (things that happen automatically, like secret scanning and code formatting), and a **learning system** that remembers what works across sessions.

## Quick Start

### What You Need

1. **Claude Code** — the CLI tool from Anthropic
2. **Node.js 18+** — the hooks are JavaScript
3. **Git** — for version control and builder isolation

### Install

```
Open your project in your IDE of choice, then open a fresh terminal and:

# 1. Clone WarpOS
git clone https://github.com/cygaco/WarpOS.git

# 2. Run the installer
node ../WarpOS/scripts/warp-setup.js

# 3
Run claude in your terminal, and perform:
/warp:setup to finish up, and then
/warp:tour to learn about the system.
```

That's it. The installer:
- Creates the directory structure your project needs
- Copies all agents, skills, and hooks
- Detects your tech stack and configures everything
- Sets up automated hooks for code quality and security
- Generates a project manifest

### Optional: provider CLIs (recommended)

WarpOS runs review agents on a *different* AI provider than the one generating code — same-model review is blind to shared failure modes. By default:

- **Evaluator / Compliance / QA / Auditor** use **OpenAI (Codex CLI)** — deeper review with a different lens
- **Redteam (security)** uses **Gemini** — different adversarial training corpus catches different attack chains
- Everything else stays on Claude

The installer auto-detects these CLIs. **Missing CLIs → graceful fallback to Claude** (still works, just loses diversity).

To get full diversity:

```powershell
# OpenAI — for review agents
npm i -g @openai/codex
codex login                         # or: $env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-..."

# Gemini — for security agent
npm i -g @google/gemini-cli
gemini auth login                   # or: $env:GEMINI_API_KEY = "..."
```

Verify with `/check:environment` after install.

### Verify

Open Claude Code in your project. Type:

```
/warp:health    — Check that everything is set up correctly
/warp:tour      — Get a guided introduction to everything
```

Then read **[USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md)** — the daily-rhythm guide. Modes, the five-terminal setup, skill sequences, and (most important) git discipline.

> **Note:** The `.claude/` directory in this repo IS the framework. When installed into your project, its contents are copied to your project's `.claude/` directory. The file paths inside agent specs reference `.claude/agents/...` — those paths are correct for the installed location in your project.

## Requirements System

Templates for every document type you need to build a product:

| Folder | What |
|--------|------|
| `00-canonical` | Product brief, model, glossary, golden paths |
| `01-design-system` | UX principles, colors, components |

## Your Project

When you install WarpOS, it creates a `manifest.json` in your `.claude/` directory. This tells Alex about your project — what framework you use, where your source code lives, what features you're building.

You can customize everything:
- Edit `CLAUDE.md` to tell Alex about your project
- Edit `.claude/manifest.json` to configure hooks and guards
- Create feature specs in your requirements directory
- Use `/skills:create` to add your own custom skills
